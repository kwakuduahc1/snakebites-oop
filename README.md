## Introduction
Snakebite victims are mostly poor rural folks in developing countries. This project discusses the out-of pocket payments experienced by snakebite victims in a rural hospital in Ghana..

## Methods
Data was extracted from the hospital's electronic health records and analysed using R (always latest version). The data forms part of my MPHIL thesis.
